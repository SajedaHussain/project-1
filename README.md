# Chemical Chaos Mode

Your game's name: 
•	Project Title: Chemical Chaos Game
•	Brief Description:
Chemical Chaos is an interactive educational game that immerses players in the role of a chemical engineer working in a high-tech laboratory. The primary objective is to stabilize the lab's reactor by assembling chemical compounds from scattered atoms within a limited time frame. Each level presents a new compound to build, with increasing complexity and stricter time constraints. Players must use speed, strategy, and precision to prevent the reactor from entering "Chemical Chaos Mode".This project emphasizes problem-solving, logical thinking, and foundational programming concepts such as state management, user interaction, and event handling.
I chose this concept to merge education with entertainment, offering a fun and engaging way for students and enthusiasts to learn chemistry basics while developing critical thinking and reaction skills.

Getting started:

•	[Game link ](https://sajedahussain.github.io/Chemical-Chaos-Game/)

•	Instructions:
1.	Drag and drop the correct atoms into the reaction zone to form the target compound.
2.	Complete the molecule before the timer runs out to avoid triggering "Chemical Chaos Mode."
3.	Progress through levels by successfully assembling increasingly complex compounds.

Next steps: 
1.	Score & Nickname System: Implement a scoring system with personalized nicknames to track player progress.
2.	Global Leaderboard: Develop a competitive leaderboard where players can compare scores and achievements worldwide.
3.	Player Rankings: Introduce rankings and tiers (e.g., Beginner, Chemist, Master) to encourage replayability and competition.
